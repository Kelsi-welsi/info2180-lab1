 <h2>Kelsi Grant </h2>
 <p>I'm a third year Computer Science student minoring in Criminology. I like dancing, swimming and watching true crime
My love for cats is about to get me kicked out of my house but I'm sure whatever happens in the end will make agreat story. I also dabble in creative writing. My field of interest is Cybersecurity and Digital forensics. After I grduate, I plan to work towards 3 to 5 certifications and a Masters in Cybersecurity, Data Privacy or Digital Forensics. Perhaps I'm oversharing, but I just intended to write enough text for this to be considered a paragraph. Fingers crossed that one day I'll work with Jacirt, MOCA or INTERPOL.</p>
