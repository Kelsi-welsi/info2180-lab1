 <h2>Kelsi Grant </h2>
 <p>I am a third year Computer Science student minoring in Criminology. It is my intetion to pursue a career in the Cybersecurity, Data Privacy and Digital Forensics side of the Computing industry. My hobbies include dancing, swimming and watching true crime. A fun fact about me is that even though I'm only 21, I'm technically a grandma to 5 cats. I think data privacy and cybercrime are issues we can't ignore and though I don't profess to be some form of superhero come to save the day, I believe in integrity and would like to put my efforts towards making that aspect of society better. I'm doing web dev because I want to understand how webpages work. I have no interest in web design really but I think to solve bigger issues, it is pertinent that I understand smaller concepts so I can navigate the bigger kahunas when I am faced with them. </p>
